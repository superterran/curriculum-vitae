# Doug Hatcher

I've worked on a mix of incredible projects spanning some of the biggest brands in America. I typically serve in a client-facing technical leadership role. In this, I usually architect and oversee development inititives. In most cases, I take ownership of the hosting infrastructure and will either implement it myself or co-own it with a hosting provider like Magento Cloud, Webscale, or Rackspace.
